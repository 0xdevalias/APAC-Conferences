# SecTalks
SecTalks meetups are about participating in IT security discussions, learning from others, and improving problem-solving skills. SecTalks offers an avenue where you can team up with like-minded people to participate in solving technical IT security challenges (i.e. Capture The Flag).

Through SecTalks CTFs, people learn and share solutions. The goal is not to just award winners but to allow people to understand the problems find solutions.
